Extension for Yii2 providing an oAuth 2 server
================================

Uses parts of [https://github.com/samdark/yii2-league-oauth2-server](https://github.com/samdark/yii2-league-oauth2-server)

Also inspired by [https://github.com/chervand/yii2-oauth2-server](https://github.com/chervand/yii2-oauth2-server)

## Install
Add this to your `composer.json`:
```json

"niolab/yii2-oauth2-server": "@dev"

```

## Usage

### Step 1
You need a few things:

- A UserRepository for this module to get its users from. The easiest is to take your existing `User` class, and make sure it also implements the following interfaces:
  - `yii\web\IdentityInterface`
  - `League\OAuth2\Server\Entities\UserEntityInterface`
  - `League\OAuth2\Server\Repositories\UserRepositoryInterface`
      - Make sure to *validate* the user in `UserRepositoryInterface::getUserEntityByUserCredentials()`
      
  Also make sure to implement `findIdentityByAccessToken()`, it's used by `NIOLAB\oauth2\components\authMethods\HttpBearerAuth` to authenticate the user by access token. Example:
  ```php
  <?php
      /**
     * {@inheritdoc}
     */
    public static function findIdentityByAccessToken($token, $type = null) {
        return static::find()
            ->where(['user.status'=>static::STATUS_ACTIVE])
            ->leftJoin('oauth_access_token', '`user`.`id` = `oauth_access_token`.`user_id`')
            ->andWhere(['oauth_access_token.identifier' => $token])
            ->one();
    }
  ```
  
  And then pass the User class as the property `$userRepository` in the configuration array as below.

- An SSH key pair. See [https://oauth2.thephpleague.com/installation/](https://oauth2.thephpleague.com/installation/)

```bash
$ openssl genrsa -out private.key 2048
$ openssl rsa -in private.key -pubout -out public.key
```

Make sure the file rights are 600 or 660 for the generated key files.

- An encryption key (just a random string)

- The migrations

```bash
$ php yii migrate --migrationPath=@vendor/niolab/yii2-oauth2-server/migrations
```

### Step 2
Add it as a yii2 module:
```php
<?php
$config = [
 'modules' => [
        'oauth2' => [
            'class' => NIOLAB\oauth2\Module::class,
            'userRepository' => \app\models\User::class,
            'privateKey' => '@common/data/keys/private.key',
            'publicKey' => '@common/data/keys/public.key',
            'encryptionKey' => 'put-a-nice-random-string-here',
        ],
    ],
];
?>
```

## Configuration
There's not a lot of configuration yet. Maybe the types of grants available will be dynamic someday.


## Access control (Guarding API calls)
The `oauth2-server` can validate Access Tokens to protect an API running on the same server (or at least with access to the same database as where the acces tokens are stored, I suppose?).

In cases where the API to restrict access to is a different system, you'll need to validate the access tokens in a different manner (the access tokens are JWT tokens so you could do something like this: [https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/tutorials/verify-access-token](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/tutorials/verify-access-token)

### Check Client Credentials
Because the Client Credentials method creates access tokens that are not linked to a specific user, it uses a different filter to check the validity of the token.

Add the `NIOLAB\oauth2\components\filters\CheckClientCredentials`  to your behaviors to validate Client Credential access keys.

### Other auth flows
Add the `NIOLAB\oauth2\components\authMethods\HttpBearerAuth`  to your behaviors, for example:
```php
<?php
 public function behaviors()
    {
        $behaviors = parent::behaviors();
        $behaviors['authenticator'] = [
            'class' => HttpBearerAuth::class,
        ];
        $behaviors['contentNegotiator'] = [
            'class' => 'yii\filters\ContentNegotiator',
            'formats' => [
                'application/json' => Response::FORMAT_JSON,
            ]
        ];

        return $behaviors;
    }
```
